EDA Report:
The customer churn analysis examined a dataset of 7,043 customers, revealing that 26.54% (1,869 customers) had churned. This high churn rate highlights areas needing attention to improve retention. Key findings and recommendations are summarized below:

### Key Findings:
1. **Senior Citizens:** Higher churn rates among senior citizens suggest a need to address challenges unique to this demographic.
2. **Contract Type:** Customers on monthly contracts churn more frequently, indicating that longer-term agreements may promote retention.
3. **Internet Service:** Fiber optic users exhibit higher churn, pointing to potential concerns about service quality or pricing.
4. **Additional Services:** Customers without add-on services (e.g., online security, backup, technical support) are more likely to churn, suggesting these services could improve retention.
5. **Payment Method:** The electronic check payment method correlates with the highest churn, possibly due to its ease of cancellation or dissatisfaction with the process.

### Recommendations:
- **Senior Citizens:** Conduct qualitative research to understand and address their concerns.
- **Contracts:** Incentivize longer-term agreements through discounts or added benefits.
- **Internet Services:** Evaluate and resolve issues related to fiber optic quality or pricing.
- **Add-On Services:** Promote the value of optional services to customers.
- **Payment Methods:** Optimize the electronic check process or explore alternatives to improve satisfaction.

By focusing on these areas, the organization can better retain customers and enhance its overall performance.
